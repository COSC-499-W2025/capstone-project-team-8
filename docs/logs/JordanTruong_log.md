### What went well
I was able to finish the planned PR on schedule and got started on the next planned one. Didn't run into that many obstacles on this PR. This PR is a good step which will help in the future when we want to easily return the users contributions in their works uploaded.

### What didn't go well
Initially, I wasn't able to get the site running with Docker. Had to spend extra time figuring out what went wrong which caused delays in my PR submissions.

### What's next
Finishing up the next PR on figuring out if a project is collaborative which shouldn't take too long, then taking more time to understand the LLM structure of our project. If I have more time 

### Reflection:
I need to accomodate for delays better by start working on the PR's earlier. That way I'll have more time incase I run into any issues. In the end, I'm satisfied with the results I produced but know I can do better next week.

### What went well
I managed my time well this week by doing my work at the start of the week rather than cramming in at the end. No big issues when working on my PR's, just one change request was made and it was simple to do. This PR helped us get closer to finishing up Mileston #1.

### What didn't go well
Although I felt better completing my work earlier in the week, it was harder to get back into it at the end of the week. Rather than working on it a lot in the beginning or end, I should try and spread out the work over the days to build consistency and work on it a little bit every day.

### What's next
Next week I'll finish up the bugfix PR and start issue https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-8/issues/109. Hopefully get it done by the end of the week with my new work plan.

### Reflection:
Need to spread out the work to build a better routing. I find it easy to continue to work on the issue until it's done but the hardest part is getting started. Overall I feel satisfied with my work this week and made progress from last week.
