### What went well
I was able to finish the planned PR on schedule and got started on the next planned one. Didn't run into that many obstacles on this PR. This PR is a good step which will help in the future when we want to easily return the users contributions in their works uploaded.

### What didn't go well
Initially, I wasn't able to get the site running with Docker. Had to spend extra time figuring out what went wrong which caused delays in my PR submissions.

### What's next
Finishing up the next PR on figuring out if a project is collaborative which shouldn't take too long, then taking more time to understand the LLM structure of our project. If I have more time 

### Reflection:
I need to accomodate for delays better by start working on the PR's earlier. That way I'll have more time incase I run into any issues. In the end, I'm satisfied with the results I produced but know I can do better next week.

## Week 12 
### November 17th - November 21st:
<img width="1075" height="629" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aee4886b-b1a9-43f7-985f-11cfe1475269" /></br>

### What went well
I managed my time well this week by doing my work at the start of the week rather than cramming in at the end. No big issues when working on my PR's, just one change request was made and it was simple to do. This PR helped us get closer to finishing up Milestone #1.

### What didn't go well
Although I felt better completing my work earlier in the week, it was harder to get back into it at the end of the week. Rather than working on it a lot in the beginning or end, I should try and spread out the work over the days to build consistency and work on it a little bit every day.

### What's next
Next week I'll start issue https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-8/issues/109. Hopefully get it done by the end of the week with my new work plan.

### Reflection:
Need to spread out the work to build a better routing. I find it easy to continue to work on the issue until it's done but the hardest part is getting started. Overall I feel satisfied with my work this week and made progress from last week.

## Week 13 
### November 24th - November 28th:
<img width="1072" height="626" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9f2f16d-13bf-403c-bfbc-b01d2a9aa222" /></br>

### What went well
Learnt a lot about the new LLM and Postman. Both of these tools will definitely improve my project efficiency. Implemented a way to summarize the top 3 ranked projects which is a big step for completing Milestone #1. I got nice feedback from Kyle M, which helped me improve the quality of my PR.

### What didn't go well
Had to postpone my work a bit since it relied on PR [#179](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-8/pull/179) and [#186](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-8/pull/186). This led me to working on the project late and not managing my time well.

### What's next
Next week, we'll be presenting our Milestone #1 progress to the class. I'm excited to see where others are at and how well we're doing.

### Reflection:
While I didn't stick to my new routine plan of short coding sessions everyday, instead of coding for an hour, I could've been researching/studying the things I needed to finish my PR before hand, so when it came down to actually working on it, I didn't need to spend as much time in one day. Overall happy with mine and the teams progress.

## Week 14 
### December 1st - December 5th:

### What went well
Our team was able to meet up and finish reviewing leftover PR's before starting our presentation. This was really effective as we were able to ask questions in real time and help each other out with any issues that occured when reviewing.

### What didn't go well
I couldn't get a PR going this week due to a busy last week of classes. That was partially my fault for not preparing sooner.

### What's next
Christmas/New years break! Then on Monday, discuss with the team our plan for Milestone #2.

### Reflection:
Because of the busy week, I couldn't stick to the plan, but new year new me, I'll start Milestone #2 stronger and better.

## Week 1 T2
### January 5th - January 11th:

### Recap:
- Reviewed Harper's PR
- Started on PR https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-8/pull/219, aiming to finish early next week

### What went well
I was able to get back into the groove of things pretty quickly after the break. I didn't run into too many issues with everything project related.

### What didn't go well
We all kinda forgot to do contributions this week until Harper realized. So I started late to the PR and ran into some issues with the database which made me unable to finish this week.

### What's next
Next week, I'll finish the PR early and get started on our next one. We still need to discuss our plan for Milestone#2.

### Reflection:
First week of classes so I'm still getting used to my new schedule but I think next week will be a lot smoother. My goal is to develop a strong routine by February.

## Week 2 T2

### Recap:

### What went well
This week I got to review more PR's than usual. I was able to quickly fix this feedback from Charlie for the deduplication PR, which would've caused more problems in the long run. 

### What didn't go well
Because I spent more time on reviewing PR's I didn't get to create many new ones. I ran into some issues with GitHub checks with our migrations. Kyle M's PR added 2 new migrations (specifically 0008) which is the same as my new migration, but I'm thinking it'll be an easy fix when we run into the merge conflict.

### What's next
Next week, continue working on the Milestone#2 requirements and prepare for the peer evals.

### Reflection:
- Used my time more efficiently this week
- Got a better understanding of how the peer evals will look like after we setup our frontend

### What went well
Was able to finish up my PR before the end of the week. We plan on meeting so that we all understand what to do for the peer testing on Monday. Got to review a lot of PR which helped me get a better understanding of where our frontend is at and what needs to be done.

### What didn't go well
Started a little late to the PR which had a bit more content than usual and had to spend a lot of time fixing minor bugs and merge conflicts once I thought I was done. 

### What's next
Next week, we'll do our peer testing and continue to focus on Milestone#2 requirements. We'll also discuss on what needs to be done in priority and how we can branch off of the resume template effectively.

### Reflection:
- Need to focus on working on PR earlier so I have more time in case bugs and conflicts appear.
- Aim for 3-4 reviews per week so I can get a better understanding of our code.

### What went well
Last week I was able to work on the project early in the week and build a better routine. I also received great feedback from the peer testings and used it to create the PR#282. This week I finished the PR#282, fixed some bugs on PR#268, and started working on implementing the portfolio system in the frontend.

### What didn't go well
Found a few bugs in my the incremental upload PR, it wouldn't show char count or file size when the new file replaces the orignal one. This ended up taking some extra time, which led me to finish things a bit last minute again.

### What's next
Next week I want to implement our portfolio system to the frontend and change the incremental upload feature to use it. I've started working on it a bit, but hope to finish it at the end of the break.
