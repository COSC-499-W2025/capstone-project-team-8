## Week 5: Sept 29 - Oct 3

This week we created our level 0 and level 1 DFD and discussed with multiple teams on what went well and what could've been done better.
- We were able to make our diagrams fairly quick with little confusion
- We could've reviewed our diagrams a bit more, so we could answer the other teams questions better

Next week, we will finalize our requirements/system design architecture, and allocate our work load.

## Week 4: Sept 22 - 28

- Created system architecture diagram
- Created project proposal

## Week 3: Sept 15 - 21

- Created requirements document
