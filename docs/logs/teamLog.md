## Week 8: Oct 20 - 24

#### This week we:
- Added additional functionality to our file analyzer
- Implemented a custom user model for our database
- Confirmed the plan for our AI host
- Setup a portable AI/LLM layer which we will host on the cloud
- Authentication setup
- Reviewed PR's and provided feedback
- Wrote tests for our new analysis functions

Our team has made a lot of progress on our extraction and analysis process. Our extraction layer is close to being complete and we will be forwarding the data to our analysis engine. Our team collaboration has been great and we have been answering eachothers questions in our group Discord channel. So far, we have had no problems as a team, and we have our tasks set for next week.

## Week 7: Oct 13 - 17

#### This week we:
- Dockerized frontend
- Dockerized backend
- Got a MySQL local database running and dockerized it
- Implemented a simple file type analyzer/classifier - this will be one of many layers of processing in our analysis pipeline
- Wrote tests for our file classifier
- Wrote tests to confirm the database connection is working
- Wrote a document on our AI/LLM server hosting plan
- Refactored our codebase
- Created issues in our kanban dashboard for next weeks sprint

Overall this was a productive week and we are just finalizing our project setup before we make major changes and updates. We will be discussing the AI model plan during next week and once that is complete, we will be working on core functionality. Our plan is to separate the file processing into multiple small layers, and this will allow us to assign chunks to each teammate independently.
  
## Week 6: Oct 6 - 12

#### This week we:
- Revised diagrams and added links to README.md file
- Added a simple Docker container setup we can build on to
- Set up Django backend framework
- Set up Next.js frontend framework
- Set up and familiarized ourselves with the expected pull request process (PR template, commenting, etc)
- Reviewed PR's and provided feedback

## Week 5: Sept 29 - Oct 5

This week we created our level 0 and level 1 DFD and discussed with multiple teams on what went well and what could've been done better.
- We were able to make our diagrams fairly quick with little confusion
- We could've reviewed our diagrams a bit more, so we could answer the other teams questions better

Next week, we will finalize our requirements/system design architecture, and allocate our work load.

## Week 4: Sept 22 - 28

- Created system architecture diagram
- Created project proposal

## Week 3: Sept 15 - 21

- Created requirements document
