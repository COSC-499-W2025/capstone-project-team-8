## Week 15

### Our Goals this week:
 This week our goal was to start working towards milestone 2 while accounting for any remaining tasks from milestone 1. Expanding on some of our previous features was key to help with our goal of building an exportable resume.

- Preview analysed resume items on a resume template
- Connect front end and back end for uploading folder
- Add image uploading for portfolio items
- File duplication checking

### Reflection
  Coming back from break we wanted to try and get on the same page as far as Milestone 2 goes. We spent some time discussing the direction we want to take for the project in regards to Milestone 2 and what we want to prioritize. We also had some things to polish off from Milestone 1 so we made sure to put an emphasis on this as well.

### What went well:
The team worked well in regards to assisting each other with development tasks. We were able to make solid progress on some key things for Milestone 2 in regards to the front end, as well as significant progress on building an exportable resume.

### What didn't go well:
Connecting the front end and back end for the upload folder feature took longer than expected on different team members machines. Some minor bugs were encountered but we were able to figure out solutions quickly.


### Test Report

### Plan for next week:

- Continue working towards Milestone 2
- Decide on a consistent UI theme for the front end
- Finalize exportable resume feature  
- Prioritize user input in the process of our feature development

## Week 13

### Our Goals this week:
Our goals for this week were to continue progressing towards Milestone 1 & 
finish our tasks as soon as possible to dedicate time towards our presentation for milestone one. Specifically, we focused on:
- Rank project importance based off user contributions
- Deliver the Azure hosted LLM deployment
- Build user API endpoints
- Bugfix the exclusion of directories during analysis
- Fix database date persistence issues
- Ship API endpoints for projects stored in the database
- Summarize top ranked projects for reporting
- Implement PDF reading and content analysis for non-AI workflows
- Add content-based resume skill extraction for writing projects
- Provide a non-AI alternative resume item generator

### Reflection
This week things flowed like usual, we spent more time on bugfixes. We seem to notice more need for refactoring and bugfixes as we progress and some of us spent time with eachother to work through the fixes and we had to contact eachother for help more often with implementation and PR reviews. We feel good about our Milestone progress and about getting things done quicker this week to work on our Milestone 1 presentation

### What went well:
  Collaboration stayed strong even as the work shifted toward stabilization. Pair-debugging helped unblock database date issues, the ranked projects flow landed without major regressions, and the Azure-hosted LLM stood up on schedule alongside new API endpoints.

### What didn't go well:
  We uncovered more schema and data consistency bugs, 'created_at' field for projects in our database caused issues with some pull requests and that specifically caused lots of headache until it was discovered. Alternative non-ai analysis took lots of time to implement and a series of 3 PRs for this. Database issues caused tests to fail and the fix was that we had to clear out our whole database

### Test Report

![alt text](data/image-1.png)

### Plan for next week:

- Present Milestone 1
- Watch other teams present their project
- Reflect on other teams ideas and progress to see where we can improve
- Prepare for Milestone 2

## Week 11 (Reading Week) & 12: Nov 10 - 22

### Our Goals for this week:
  Our goals for this week were to make progress towards finalizing things for Milestone 1. This included more database integration with uploaded projects, improving our analysis engine, and finishing off any unfinished areas of development for the analyzer. Alongside some minor bug fixes our focus was mainly poloshing off some rough edges that needed attention before the submission. The database is the last major step for the project in regards to this milestone so this was also of key focus for us this week.


### Reflection:
  This week development went very smoothly with little to no blockers. The team worked well and collaborated nicely to assist each other in areas where needed. The database now saving projects was massive for us this week as well, now we are able to store results from the analysis and we will be able to hopefully have massive performance increases as a result from this. We are feeling good about our progress towards Milestone 1 and are excited to see the final product come together.


### What went well:
  Development was definitely the highlight for our group this week. Each of us made solid progress this week and we were able to get a lot done. Our analyzer is nearly complete which allows us to focus on the final steps for the project in this last week.


### What didn't go well:
  There were minimal issues this week, however we did run into some small bugs with saving into the database and the data models. These have been resolved for the most part but will need some final polishing before Milestone 1.

## Week 10: Nov 2 - 9

### Our Goals for this week:
Our goal for this week was to deepen our analysis of uploaded files and progress towards AI integration. For uploaded files, we aimed to enhance our file analyzer to read text from uploaded content documents as well as discover tech stacks and languages used in coding projects. This work being done is pivotal to both a non AI and AI based analysis of user projects. The more information we can extract from uploaded files, the better our analysis engine will perform. Another goal for this week was to analyze deeper the .git file in a detected repository, trying to distinguish user contributions is a key step towards milestone 1.


### Reflection:
This weeks development went smoothly with minimal hitches. The team collaborated well to implement new features and make decisions for our projects direcetion. As we dive deepper into content analysis the project is starting to take shape and we are excited to see progress. The teams focus shifting forward is to better understand the read content of uploaded files this week was focused on accessing the files now we have to take it a step further and understand what is in those files. AI will help with this but determining a non AI approach is also important for our project.


### What went well:
Development was smooth this week with minimal blockers. We were able to stay on track with our goals and each make strong team and individual contributions. Our implemented features are being strengthened as well being able to deeper understand user's uploaded files.


### What didn't go well:
As we work in our file uploader component the file is begining to grow in size and complexity. We must begin to make decisions on how to modularize and structure our code to ensure further development is smooth and efficient. Small refactoring was done this week but it should become a larger focus moving forward.

### Next Weeks Plan Towards Milestone 1 
Looking forwards towards Milestone 1 our key objectives are content analysis based, specifically:,
5. Have alternative analyses in place if sending data to an external service is not permitted
9. Extrapolate individual contributions for a given collaboration project 
10. Extract key contribution metrics in a project, displaying information about the duration of the project and activity type contribution frequency (e.g., code vs test vs design vs document), and other important information 
11. Extract key skills from a given project 


### Test Report


## Week 9: Oct 25 - 29

### Our Goals for this week:

Our goal for this week was:
  - Setup LLM cloud server #70 #83 
  - Implement JWT based auth #92
  - Refactor login view to return JSON #73 
  - Refactor JSON output for queries #76 
  - Find user contributions in .git files #62

  - Create Milestone 1 progress report #90
  - Implement feature to detect projects without a repository #72

  ### Reflection:
  This week was our first encounter with system breaking bugs. Expecting development to continue as it has this threw a curve ball into our plans for the week. However, the team came together to resolve these issues and use the opportunity to refactor and modularize our code. Overall, we are still happy with our progress being able to make significant developments despite the setbacks.

  ### What went well:
  - Successfully set up the LLM cloud server
  - JWT based authentication successfully protects all our routes
  - Refactored lots of code to ensure future development is smoother and more modular

  ### What didn't go well:
  - Some team members had trouble setting up the cloud server locally
  - Unexpected bugs and errors forced us to refactor code multiple times
  - Some tasks took longer than expected, leading to minor delays

## Week 7: Oct 13 - 17

#### This week we:
- Dockerized frontend
- Dockerized backend
- Got a MySQL local database running and dockerized it
- Implemented a simple file type analyzer/classifier - this will be one of many layers of processing in our analysis pipeline
- Wrote tests for our file classifier
- Wrote tests to confirm the database connection is working
- Wrote a document on our AI/LLM server hosting plan
- Refactored our codebase
- Created issues in our kanban dashboard for next weeks sprint

Overall this was a productive week and we are just finalizing our project setup before we make major changes and updates. We will be discussing the AI model plan during next week and once that is complete, we will be working on core functionality. Our plan is to separate the file processing into multiple small layers, and this will allow us to assign chunks to each teammate independently.
  
## Week 6: Oct 6 - 12

#### This week we:
- Revised diagrams and added links to README.md file
- Added a simple Docker container setup we can build on to

## Week 5: Sept 29 - Oct 5

This week we created our level 0 and level 1 DFD and discussed with multiple teams on what went well and what could've been done better.
- We were able to make our diagrams fairly quick with little confusion
- We could've reviewed our diagrams a bit more, so we could answer the other teams questions better

Next week, we will finalize our requirements/system design architecture, and allocate our work load.

## Week 4: Sept 22 - 28

- Created system architecture diagram
- Created project proposal

## Week 3: Sept 15 - 21

- Created requirements document
