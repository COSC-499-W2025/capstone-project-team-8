## üìà Technical Debt & Known Issues

1. **No frontend UI** - Backend API ready but no user interface
2. **Limited error handling** - Need more robust exception handling
3. **No authentication on upload endpoint** - Currently open to all users
4. **No project data persistence** - Analysis results only returned as JSON, not saved to database
5. **Missing database models** - No Project, File, or Portfolio models exist
6. **LLM service not in main** - Deployed on separate branch, needs integration
7. **Project duration not extracted** - Git dates not being parsed yet
8. **Activity type breakdown missing** - Can't distinguish code vs test vs doc contributions
9. **No caching** - Repeated analysis of same files
10. **No async processing** - Large uploads block the request
