# These are the categories that a file will be classified as based off its extension
# The current system is expecting a zip files to be uploaded
# After these are scanned they would get sent to a respective analyzer
# Currently, it can only distinguish between repositories by searching them for a ".git" folder.
# Anything found within that folder would be tagged as part of that repository.
# Found projects are given two tags, one that is numeric (project_tag) and one that is human-readable (project_root).
# Project tag is increased sequentially starting at 1 for each discovered repository.
# Anything found outside of any .git folder would not receive a project tag.
